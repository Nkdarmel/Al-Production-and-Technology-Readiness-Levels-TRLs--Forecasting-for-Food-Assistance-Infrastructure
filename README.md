# Al-Production-and-Technology-Readiness-Levels-TRLs--Forecasting-for-Food-Assistance-Infrastructure
Developing a comprehensive toolset using advanced geospatial technologies (TRLs 3-7) for food assistance infrastructure. Combining data sources with machine learning and spatial analysis to forecast food production/availability in humanitarian contexts.


Project Overview

This project aims to develop an innovative toolset that utilizes advanced geospatial technologies, methods, and models (TRLs 3-7) to support food assistance infrastructure. The comprehensive system will integrate data from various sources, including satellite imagery, weather stations, agricultural surveys, market reports, and more, using machine learning algorithms and spatial analysis techniques to forecast food production and availability in humanitarian contexts. To achieve this goal, the project will collect relevant data (TRL 3-7), preprocess it into a unified format, develop machine learning models using regression analysis, decision trees, or other suitable techniques, apply spatial analysis techniques such as GIS and remote sensing to visualize and analyze environmental factors, infrastructure development, and market dynamics on food systems. The integrated system will provide a comprehensive view of food production and availability, enabling more effective food assistance planning and response in humanitarian crises.

In this project, we used Python code snippets for data processing, modeling, and visualization. We also set up an IDE (PyCharm) and DevOps tools (Docker) to automate testing and deployment of our code using CI/CD pipelines. This enables more efficient development, testing, and deployment of geospatial technologies, methods, and models for food assistance infrastructure.

Components

Data Processing

 This component will handle the ingestion, cleaning, and processing of relevant datasets (e.g., climate data, soil moisture levels, crop yields).

Modeling

Develop predictive models using machine learning libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow to forecast food production based on historical trends, weather patterns, and other factors.

Visualization

Create interactive visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to display the results of your modeling efforts.

Python Code

Here are some Python code snippets for each component:

### Data Processing

```python
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

# Load climate data from CSV file
climate_data = pd.read_csv('data/climate.csv')

# Clean and process data (e.g., convert dates to datetime format)
climate_data['date'] = [datetime.strptime(d, '%Y-%m-%d') for d in climate_data['date']]
```

### Modeling

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load processed data from previous step
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(climate_data.drop('production', axis=1), climate_data['production'], test_size=0.2)

# Train a random forest regressor model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```



Mathematical Formulas

The `RandomForestRegressor` is a type of ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. Here are some key mathematical concepts:

Decision Trees

A decision tree is a simple model that splits the data into subsets based on feature values and recursively applies this process until each leaf node represents a single class or value.

Mathematically, a decision tree can be represented as follows:

```python
T(x) = 
  {
    if x ∈ R: c_0 (root node)
    else: T_left(x) if f(x) < threshold
          T_right(x) otherwise
  }
```
where `x` is the input feature, `R` is a region in the feature space, `c_0` is the class label at the root node, and `f(x)` is a splitting function.

2. **Random Forest:** A random forest is an ensemble of multiple decision trees trained on bootstrapped samples of the data. Each tree is grown independently using a subset of features and training examples.

Mathematically, a random forest can be represented as follows:
```python
RF(X) = 
  {
    for i=1 to M: 
      Ti(x) = T_i(xi)
    return ∑i=1 to M wi * Ti(x)
  }
```
where `X` is the input feature vector, `M` is the number of trees in the forest, `Ti(x)` is the prediction made by tree `i`, and `wi` is the weight assigned to each tree.

Predicted Production

The predicted production value can be calculated using the random forest model as follows:
```python
predicted_production = RF(X)
```
where `X` is the input feature vector representing the climate data, and `RF(X)` is the output of the random forest model.

Visualization 1

Seaborn 

Let's use Seaborn to visualize the predicted production values using a scatter plot.


```python
import seaborn as sns

# Load the predicted production values from earlier
pred_values = pd.DataFrame(y_pred, columns=['predicted_production'])

# Create a scatter plot with actual vs. predicted production values
sns.scatterplot(x='actual_production', y='predicted_production', data=pred_values)

# Add some annotations to highlight important points (e.g., mean absolute error)
sns.kdeplot(pred_values['actual_production'], shade=True, color='gray')
sns.lineplot(x=range(len(y_pred)), y=y_ pred.mean(), label='Mean Absolute Error')

plt.xlabel('Actual Production  (tons)')
plt.ylabel('Predicted Production  (tons)')
plt.title('Food Production Forecasting Results')
plt.show()
```

This code snippet creates a scatter plot showing the actual vs. predicted production values, with some additional annotations to highlight important points.

Mathematical Formulas in Seaborn

Seaborn provides an intuitive way to visualize data using mathematical formulas. You can use the `kdeplot` function to create a kernel density estimate (KDE) of the actual production values.

```python

sns.kdeplot(pred_values['actual_production'], shade=True, color='gray')
```
This code snippet uses the KDE formula:
```math
f(x) = ∫[−∞,∞] K((x - u)/h) du
```
where `K` is a kernel function (e.g., Gaussian), and `u` is an arbitrary point in the feature space.

IDE: PyCharm

To use PyCharm as your IDE, follow these steps:

1. Install PyCharm from the official website.
2. Create a new project in PyCharm by selecting "File" > "New Project..." and choosing the Python template.
3. Configure the project settings to include the necessary libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, Pandas).
4. Write your code using PyCharm's built-in editor.

DevOps Tools: Docker

To use Docker as a DevOps tool for this project, follow these steps:

1. Install Docker from the official website.
2. Create a new Dockerfile in the root directory of your project:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```
This Dockerfile installs Python 3.9, sets up a working directory for the app, copies the `requirements.txt` file and installs dependencies using Pip, and finally runs the main script.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

To set up CI/CD pipelines for this project, follow these steps:

1. Create a new GitHub repository for your project.
2. Set up a Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment of your code:
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t my-app .'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker run -it --rm my-app python main.py'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker tag my-app:latest <your-repo-name>/my-app:latest'
                sh 'docker push <your-repo-name>/my-app:latest'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
This pipeline builds a Docker image, runs tests using the `main.py` script, and deploys the image to your repository.
